# Real-Time Image and Video Dehazing Based on Multiscale Guided Filtering - Unofficial OpenCV-Python Implementation

Codebase for the reimplemented of the focus [paper](https://rdcu.be/cTCIV).

\***Impotant Note**\*

  This code is not working properly right now. I decided to publish this for a starting point for those who want to implement [MGF-Dehazing](https://github.com/viengiaan/MGF_dehazing) in Python. 

  I can not make time for personal projects right now. Anybody who wants to contribute feel free :)

## Reimplementers:

Serkan Åžatak | [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en) (ITU)

## Resources

- [Original Paper](https://rdcu.be/cTCIV) (Springer Open-Access)
- [Official MATLAB Source](https://github.com/viengiaan/MGF_dehazing) (GitHub)

## Python requirements
This code was tested on below requirements but it is possible that it works in older versions.

- Python 3.9
- OpenCV 4.7
- Numpy 1.20

## Installation
1. Create an Anaconda/venv environment (Optional)
2.  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## TO-DO

1. Finding exact equivalents of MATLAB functions
2. OpenCV-GPU for faster processing
3. Reimplementation with Kornia
